Game Concept: Sector Zero (Final Version)

1. The Logline

Sector Zero is a retro-style survival horror game where you, a lowly intern, try to stop an interdimensional invasion, only for your desperate attempt to accidentally trigger the end of the world.

2. Project Framework

    Game Jam Theme: "You don't belong here."

    Genre: Survival Stealth / Horror

    Technology: Godot (C#)

    Visual Style: Retro 3D (Wolfenstein 3D aesthetic)

3. The Premise

You are an intern at a secret research facility. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you break into the forbidden Sector 0. You quickly discover why it's off-limits: at its center is a massive portal to another dimension.

But something is wrong. The scientists who sent people through have lost control. The portal is now a one-way street, coming in. Instead of sending people out, it's letting "something" in.

4. The Threat: "The Intruders"

Forget ghosts. These are active, hostile entities from the other side.

    Visuals: In our retro style, these will be 2D sprite-based monsters (billboards). They can be bizarre, Lovecraftian, etc.

    AI: They are actively hunting you. They patrol hallways, react to sound, and will chase you down.

    Gameplay: This is Survival Stealth. You're an intern; you have no weapons. You must sneak, hide behind corners, use the darkness, and run. Think Amnesia or Alien: Isolation in a Wolfenstein world.

5. The Goal: The Shutdown Attempt

Your mission is clear: You must shut down that portal at all costs.

    The Task: The main console at the portal is locked by an emergency protocol.

    The Mechanic: To unlock it, you must sneak or fight your way through the three wings of Sector 0 (e.g., The Power Station, The Server Hub, The Coolant Facility) and activate 3 Emergency Override Switches.

    Tension: Each switch you flip causes more chaos in the complex (maybe more intruders spawn, the lights flicker, etc.).

6. The Finale (The Twist)

After activating all 3 switches, you race back to the main console. It's unlocked.

You slam the big red button labeled "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN."

For a moment, there's silence.

Then, a terrifying noise. The portal doesn't close—it collapses violently. Your shutdown attempt destabilized the entire system. Instead of closing, the portal tears open, creating a massive "Rift" that begins to merge the two dimensions.

You see the walls of the lab tear away, revealing the alien landscape on the other side.

The screen fades to white.

End.

7. How We Hit The Theme ("You don't belong here")

    YOU: You're an intern in a forbidden zone. You don't belong here.

    THEM: The Intruders are in our dimension. They don't belong here.

    THE RESULT: In the end, neither dimension belongs where it is. Reality itself is wrong.
